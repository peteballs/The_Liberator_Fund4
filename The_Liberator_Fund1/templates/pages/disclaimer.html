  <h1>Risk Disclaimer</h1>
  <p>
The Liberator Fund, makes no guarantees as to the amount of money you may profit or lose by using our software. FOREX Trading is risky for all involved and has the potential for huge losses. We make no promises as to future earnings by using our software and employ the software at your own risk.

Risks Associated with FOREX and trading foreign currencies is a challenging and potentially profitable opportunity for educated and experienced traders. However, before deciding to participate in the FOREX market, you should carefully consider your trading objectives, level of experience and risk. Most importantly, do not trade with money you cannot afford to lose.

There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency or currency pair.

Moreover, the leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated, and you will be responsible for any resulting losses. Traders may lower their exposure to risk by employing risk-reducing strategies such as "stop-loss" or "limit" orders.

There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection. The Liberator Fund is not responsible for communication failures or delays when trading via the Internet. The Liberator Fund employs backup systems and contingency plans to minimize the possibility of system failure.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. " 1 et seq. ("FAA"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Florida.

Process

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of Florida and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.

Location and Procedure

Unless you and The Liberator Fund otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and The Liberator Fund submitted to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

Arbitrator"s Decision

The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant"s individual claim. An Arbitrator"s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator"s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.

Fees

Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, The Liberator Fund will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

Other Provisions
Choice of Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement above or in supplemental terms applicable to your region. However, the choice of law provision regarding the interpretation of these Terms is not intended to create any other substantive right to non- Floridians to assert claims under Florida law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise. These provisions, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6 of these Terms, are only intended to specify the use of Florida law to interpret these Terms and the forum for disputes asserting a breach of these Terms, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending Florida law to you if you do not otherwise reside in Florida. The foregoing choice of law and forum selection provisions do not apply to the arbitration clause in Section 6 or to any arbitrable disputes as defined therein. Instead, as described in Section 6, the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to any such disputes. Notice.
